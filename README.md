## Important Notes

There are four ways of Conditional rendering.....

1. Using Element Variable in Conditions....
2. Using Ternary Operator.... 
3. Using && Operator (shorthand)...
4. Using || Operator (shorthand)....


### Uses of Conditional Rendering...

Based on required Number of Conditions we need to pick a way of Conditional rendering..

1. Element variable in Conditions and Ternary Operators are used when there are more than 1 Condition to be fulfilled.... e.g(if this <btn1> else that <btn2>) or (this ? <btn1> : <btn2>)....

2. Otherwise when rendering needs to be done on a single state of Condition we Can use shorthands....

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Important Notes on Conditional Rendering...

There are four ways of Conditional rendering.....

1. Using Element Variable in Conditions....
2. Using Ternary Operator.... 
3. Using && Operator (shorthand)...
4. Using || Operator (shorthand)....


### Uses of Conditional Rendering...

Based on required Number of Conditions we need to pick a way of Conditional rendering..

1. Element variable in Conditions and Ternary Operators are used when there are more than 1 Condition to be fulfilled.... e.g(if this <btn1> else that <btn2>) or (this ? <btn1> : <btn2>)....

2. Otherwise when rendering needs to be done on a single state of Condition we Can use shorthands....


## Context Api..

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

### Steps of setting up A context api and Using it......


1. We have create the context on the Component at the highest level of tree or More importantly where the function,variable,array,object, or even The  state exists that we want to send toa a child component inside.....

2. First we have to create Context outside the component function....  Purely because we have to export it to get using import from our desired component... 
e.g( export const NameContext = React.createContext({default value}))

3. {name} can be anything.....

4. Then we have to wrap the Components we want to send data into inside A React Component..... Likewise we wrapped <APP> with <BrowserRouter> in index.js for routing setup....
e.g(<NameContext.Provider value={anything}> {<childComponents>} </NameContext.Provider>)

5. In (<NameContext.Provider value={}>) value is the the property where we send the data we want to send, it can be hardCoded('anything'), or it can be a variable we declared before({ornament}), or can be a state we declared using useState(), ({house})...... can be a function, an Array an Object, anything hardCoded or dynamic.....

6. Now to receive the data anywhere inside the tree...  We can use a Hook.... useContext(name)...name the Context inside the hook...... and assign whatever we have received in a variable....
e.g(const variable = useContext(name))
